Advantages
- They autonomously and adaptively search for the minimum state.
- External image forces act upon the snake in an intuitive manner.
- Incorporating Gaussian smmoothing in the image energy function introduces scale sensitivity
- They can be used to track dynamic objects
Drawbacks
- They are sensitive to local minima states, which can be counteracted by simulated annealing techniques.
- Minute features are often ignored during energy minimization over the entire contour.
- Their accuracy depends on the convergence policy.
